# Major Issues and Limitations

## Security Concerns
1. ✅ Rate limiting implemented for authentication attempts
2. ✅ Enhanced CSRF protection with token regeneration
3. ✅ Improved file upload validation with mime type checking
4. Session management improved with periodic regeneration
5. Password reset functionality needs improvement

## Architecture Issues
1. Direct database queries in controllers instead of using models
2. Inconsistent error handling across controllers
3. Missing proper dependency injection
4. Hardcoded configuration values in some controllers
5. No proper service layer implementation

## Code Quality
1. Duplicate code in ProfileController and AuthController
2. Inconsistent coding style across files
3. Missing proper documentation for complex functions
4. Large controller files (ProfileController, AuthController) need refactoring
5. Inconsistent use of prepared statements in database queries

## Performance
1. No caching implementation for frequently accessed data
2. Large image uploads not optimized
3. Missing database indexes on frequently queried columns
4. No pagination implementation for large data sets
5. Inefficient chat message loading

## User Experience
1. No proper form validation feedback
2. Missing loading states for async operations
3. Inconsistent error messages
4. No proper mobile optimization for some features
5. Missing proper accessibility features

## Testing
1. No automated tests implemented
2. Missing unit tests for critical functionality
3. No integration tests
4. No performance testing
5. Missing security testing

## Documentation
1. Incomplete API documentation
2. Missing inline code documentation
3. No proper changelog
4. Missing deployment documentation
5. Incomplete database schema documentation

## Infrastructure
1. No proper logging implementation
2. Missing monitoring and alerting
3. No backup strategy documented
4. Missing proper error tracking
5. No proper deployment pipeline

## Feature Limitations
1. AI matching algorithm needs improvement
2. Limited search filters
3. Basic chat functionality without advanced features
4. No proper notification system
5. Limited profile customization options

## New Issues Identified
1. Redis dependency for rate limiting needs fallback mechanism
2. File upload validation needs to be implemented across all controllers
3. Session storage needs to be configured for better security
4. Need to implement proper error logging and monitoring
5. Need to add proper API documentation for all endpoints
